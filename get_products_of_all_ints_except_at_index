'''
You have a list of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index.
Assumes list do not have an element as 0
Below is a small O(n) solution 
'''



A = [ 1,3,4,5]
sum = 1
for v in A:
    sum *= v
tmp =[]

for v in A:
    tmp.append(sum/v)

print tmp
